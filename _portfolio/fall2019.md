* ### Meta-Sim - Group Project
This semester we will try out a new group project exercise, one that will rely on a simulated data set that I developed. In a nutshell, the data set is intended to represent a large-scale data collection effort from employees in one or more organizations (imagine collecting a lot of data using Qualtrics). The data set was generated from a 50×49 meta-analytic correlation matrix that was populated from a series of metaBUS (see metaBUS.org) queries. This means that all descriptive statistics, correlations, etc. are supported by meta-analytic evidence and, thus, reflect phenomena in the *real* world. Project teams will use the simulated data set to complete a semester-long project, which will require them to use an established theoretical model to examine at least five research questions. A project timetable is provided in the course syllabus.
