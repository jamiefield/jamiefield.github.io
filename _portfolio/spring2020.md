   * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/Conceptual Model Example.pdf?dl=0">Conceptual Model Example</a>
      * It is important that each group creates a model like the one that is depicted in this example. (The model should be included in the "consultation meeting summary group project submission.) A model like this will be the foundation for your group's data collection instrument. Put differently, your model will determine what questions will be asked on your survey and, thus, what evidence-based practice recommendations your group can make. Indeed, you can only make recommendations based on the evidence that was collected. Importantly, the model should be supported by theory! Otherwise, there may be little support for why the variables included in the model are related to each other.
    * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/Qualtrics tutorial.doc?dl=0">Introduction/Step-by-step guide to creating and distributing a survey in Qualtrics</a>  
    * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/Introduction-Preamble.doc?dl=0">Introduction/Preamble for Qualtrics survey</a>
      * Each group should use this. Copy and paste the attached text into the survey as the first question (make sure you reduce the number of response options [see the right panel in Qualtrics] to zero).

 * ### Excel tutorials
     * Text-to-columns
        * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/wvuMBBall_results.xlsx?dl=0">WVU Men's Basketball results</a>
           * We will use this .csv file to separate the "Result" column into three new columns (i.e., W or L, Away Team Score, and Home Team Score). From here, we can estimate some interesting statistics (e.g., win percentage, average team score)!
           * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/Text to Columns Tutorial.docx?dl=0">Text-to-columns tutorial</a>
               * Use this guide as a reference if need help learning the text-to-columns procedure
         * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/Text-to-columns.xlsx?dl=0">Class roster</a>
            * Use this file to practice your text-to-columns skills. Specifically, separate Column A, which contains each student's name in the "last name, first name" format, into two separate columns. 
            * The file contains several other formula-driven cells (see Column C and Columns F-H). Column C removes the unnecessary space (i.e., the first character) from the cells in Column B. Columns F-G then counts the number of characters in the Columns A-C.
 
   * COUNTIF statements
      * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/countIF.xlsx?dl=0">A COUNTIF example using categories of race</a>
         * In this example, five categories of race are summarized using the COUNTIF function. See Column H for the application of the COUNTIF function.
   
   * IF statements 
      * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/sampleData.csv?dl=0">A sample data set to be used in class</a>
         * In this example data set, you can dummy code the "Sex" data (see Column B) using an IF statement
      * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/IF_function_II.xlsx?dl=0">IF function examples and exercises</a>
         * This file contains three separate examples and corresponding exercises. In the first exercise, you will be asked to use an IF statement to identify is greater than the column median. In the second exercise, you will be asked to use an IF statement to count the number of color matches. In the third exercise, you will be asked to use an IF statement to identify the number of teams ending in "State" (e.g., Kansas State).

   * VLOOKUP
      * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/vlookup_race.xlsx?dl=0">A VLOOKUP example using categories of race</a>
         * In this example, five categories of race are summarized using the COUNTIF function. See Column C and Column H for the application of the VLOOKUP function.
