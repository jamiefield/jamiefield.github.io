   * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/Conceptual Model Example.pdf?dl=0">Conceptual Model Example</a>
      * It is important that each group creates a model like the one that is depicted in this example. (The model should be included in the "consultation meeting summary group project submission.) A model like this will be the foundation for your group's data collection instrument. Put differently, your model will determine what questions will be asked on your survey and, thus, what evidence-based practice recommendations your group can make. Indeed, you can only make recommendations based on the evidence that was collected. Importantly, the model should be supported by theory! Otherwise, there may be little support for why the variables included in the model are related to each other.

 * ### Excel tutorials
    * Tutorial #1: Text-to-columns
        * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/wvuMBBall_results.xlsx?dl=0">WVU Men's Basketball results</a>
           * We will use this .csv file to separate the "Result" column into three new columns (i.e., W or L, Away Team Score, and Home Team Score). From here, we can estimate some interesting statistics (e.g., win percentage, average team score)!
           * <a href="https://us-lti.bbcollab.com/recording/3a5e778c579f4bbebda634889ddb047a">Video link to Tutorial #1a</a>           
           * <a href="http://jamiefield.github.io/files/Text to Columns Tutorial.docx?dl=0">Text-to-columns tutorial</a>
               * Use this guide as a reference if need help learning the text-to-columns procedure

            * Use this file to practice your text-to-columns skills. Specifically, separate Column A, which contains each student's name in the "last name, first name" format, into two separate columns. 
            * The file contains several other formula-driven cells (see Column C and Columns F-H). Column C removes the unnecessary space (i.e., the first character) from the cells in Column B. Columns F-G then counts the number of characters in the Columns A-C.
