<b>MetaSen</b>
<br>
Meta-analytic reviews are the primary means for generating cumulative knowledge and their results are often used to inform evidence-based practice. Although recent research indicates that outliers and publication bias can distort meta-analytic results, analyses are rarely conducted to assess their independent effects. Moreover, analyses that account for the combined effect of these phenomena are almost completely nonexistent. Consequently, the potential non-robustness of meta-analytic results often goes undetected, which brings into question the trustworthiness of our cumulative knowledge. I developed a Shiny interface, called <a href="https://metasen.shinyapps.io/gen1/">metaSen</a>, that will facilitate the conduct of meta-analyses that adhere to recommended reporting standards and best practices. Specifically, we introduce Meta-Sen â€“ an open access software that allows users to upload a meta-analytic dataset and provides as output essential meta-analytic and sensitivity analysis results.
