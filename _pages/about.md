<h1> About </h1>
<p>I am an Assistant of Management at West Virginia University's <a href="https://business.wvu.edu">John Chambers College of Business and Economics</a>. My research focuses on topics pertaining to organizational behvaior, human research management, and organizational research mthods and has been published in outlets like <i>Science</i>, <i>Nature: Human Behavior</i>, <i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i>, <i>Personnel Psychology</i>, and <i>Journal of Business and Psychology</i>. I am interested in how big data can be leveraged to improve organizational research methodology and better our understanding of organizational behavior and human resource management phenomena. In particular, I believe that the unification of large and diverse data sets, existing statistical analysis techniques like meta-analysis and relative importance analysis, and sound theoretical reasoning will help create science that is worthy of guiding practice.</p>
