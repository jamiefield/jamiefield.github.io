I am an Assistant of Management at West Virginia University's <a href="https://business.wvu.edu">John Chambers College of Business and Economics</a>. My research focuses on topics pertaining to organizational behvaior, human research management, and organizational research mthods. In particular, I am interested in how big data can be leveraged to improve organizational research methodology and better our understanding of organizational behavior and human resource management phenomena. I believe that the unification of large and diverse data sets, existing statistical analysis techniques like meta-analysis and relative importance analysis, and sound theoretical reasoning will help create science that is worthy of guiding practice.

I am an active contributor to and member of the <a href="https://metaBUS.org">metaBUS</a> project, an international program that has received approximately $1 million in funding from agencies like the National Science Foundation and the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) Foundation. The metaBUS project aims to curate and disseminate volumes of scientific research, thereby making it easier to quantify and visualize answers to big science questions. Currently, the metaBUS database is made up of more than 1.1 million correlation coefficients and corresponding meta-data (e.g., sample size, reliability coefficient), which have been extracted from approximately 15,000 articles published in more than 25 OB/HR journals since 1980. Importantly, each correlation coefficient is tagged to a hierarchical taxonomy of 4,869 variables reported in the scientific space of applied psychology <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0038047">(Bosco, Aguinis, Singh, Field, & Pierce, 2015)</a>. The taxonomy arranges variables into broad branches (e.g., attitudes; behaviors) and then into finer levels of granularity. For example, the taxonomic path to arrive at overall job satisfaction is “attitudes&#8594;job attitudes&#8594;general job affect&#8594;positive&#8594;job satisfaction.” The utility of this approach is that, in addition to specific, targeted queries, it permits very broad queries. For example, one may query the database for all “attitude-behavior” relations.
